**(*ME 555: Intro to Robotics* Final Project, Fall 2025)**

Collaborated with 4 other mechanical engineering students to simulate. A YOLO pipeline detects a number of fingers that the user holds up, and calculates the mass that the user would like to have poured. The Kinova Gen 3 Lite robot arm then picks up a container with (rice was used for testing), and pours it into a second cup. A custom scale, comprised of a load cell and an HX711 amplifier monitors the and sends the information to the ROS2 script of the current mass. 

My contributions included the design of the scale and code to integrate it into the robot pipeline.
